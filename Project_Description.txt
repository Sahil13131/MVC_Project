The Student Record System, built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure, ensures a clean separation of 
concerns, thereby enhancing maintainability and scalability. This design allows for efficient management of student 
data, a streamlined user interface, and robust backend processes. Furthermore, I have implemented design patterns such 
as the Singleton and Factory design patterns to enable seamless updates and modifications to the project without 
disrupting the overall system integrity.
